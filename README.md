# Anime Movie Ticket Booking Website

## Project Overview
This is a minimalist, responsive front-end website for booking movie tickets to five popular anime titles:  
**Sakamoto Days, Black Clover, Demon Slayer, Attack on Titan, and My Hero Academia.**  
The entire site features a **One Piece-themed wallpaper background** for a consistent anime vibe.

## How It Works
- **Homepage:**  
  Users can log in or sign up using simple forms (no backend, just front-end validation).  
  The homepage also displays clickable movie covers linking to each anime’s dedicated page.

- **Anime Movie Pages:**  
  Each page shows the anime’s cover, description, showtimes, and a booking form.  
  Users fill out their name, email, select showtime and number of tickets, then submit the form.  
  Form inputs are validated on the client side.

- **Booking Confirmation:**  
  After successful booking, users are redirected to a confirmation page showing a payment success message.

- **Navigation:**  
  A consistent header with navigation links and a hamburger menu on mobile devices allows smooth movement between pages.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 for semantic structure  
- CSS3 for styling, responsiveness, and animations  
- JavaScript for interactivity, form validation, and navigation toggles
